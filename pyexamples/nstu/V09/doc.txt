V08 didn't converge, but heading in the right direction

Adding more radial points in core (7 doesnt look like enough)
^can't add more. grid generator keeps crashing

Changed solver package to ilut; added mfnksol & nurlx; relax BC for the first part to help convergence.
Changed ion power to 1MW (Ti solved in V08 was way too high; should be around 50-100 eV)

Maybe diffusitivities are very wrong...
